# XMC quadcopter
DIY Infineon XMC4500 Microcontroller based flight controller and quadcopter full assembly.

This tutorial is based on the original work of jherkenhoff, see the link: https://github.com/jherkenhoff/XMC_Cleanflight_Doc
Whereas the original GIT / tutorial was focusing on the Flight Controller bringup, this GIT is focused on the whole drone assembly incl. flight controller, from scratch. 

The flight controller Cleanflight was ported for the Infineon XMC4500 MCU (ARM Cortex M4 based) on the "Cerasus" PCB.

For those unfamiliar with Cleanflight. It is an open source flight-controller firmware which is used on a broad range of commercial and open source flight-controllers. Since it is targeted towards 32 bit MCU's it provides a perfect base for the Cerasus board / XMC4500 MCU.
